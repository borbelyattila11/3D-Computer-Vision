## Perspective Camera
Perspective camera is a model used to simulate the way a real-world camera captures images from a 3D scene onto a 2D plane. The perspective camera assumes that light rays emanate from a 3D scene, pass through a point known as the camera center, and project onto a 2D image plane.
