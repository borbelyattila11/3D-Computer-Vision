# Basic Estimation Theory

## Inhomogeneous Linear System
In many 3D vision problems, we have an overdetermined system where $m > n$, meaning there are more equations than unknowns. In such cases, there is no exact solution that satisfies all equations, but we can find approximate solution using **least squares**.

$Ax = b$

Where:
- $A ∈ R^{m × n}$ is a matrix with $m$ equations and $n$ unknonws (variables).
